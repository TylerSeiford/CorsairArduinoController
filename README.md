# CorsairArduinoController
This is the code for my knock off Corsair CommanderPRO using an ATmega32u4 based arduinno.

## Hardware
This uses an arduino pro micro (ATmega32u4) based microcontroller to control addressable and non addressable LED strips.  It utilizes the [CorsairLightingProtocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) and builds on top of it to add additional functionality.
