# CorsairController
This is the code and kicad files for my knock off Corsair CommanderPRO using an ATmega32u4 microcontroller.

## Hardware
This uses an ATmega32u4 microcontroller to control addressable and non addressable LED strips, along with 3 and 4 pin DC fans.  It utilizes the [CorsairLightingProtocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) and builds on top of it to add additional functionality.
